# Blockchain Node GCP

In this repository, we provide a terraform configuration to deploy an Ethereum node on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that connects to the "hoodi" testnet. This setup is intended for self-learning purposes and can be customized based on your requirements.

This repository also contains an script to interact with the Ethereum node for testing the blockchain node whether can syncronize with the testnet or not.
